I am a 3rd year student at Ecole Polytechnique, Franceâ€™s leading school of science and engineering. This year, I major in Applied Mathematics, focusing mainly on statistics and probability, optimization, data science (ML and DL) as well as financial engineering. This website gathers all the project in which I participated throughout my studies at Ecole Polytechnique.
